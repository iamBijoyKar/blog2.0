Like a Pro with Search Syntax\r\n\r\nGoogle is the most popular and powerful search engine in the world, but many people don&#39;t know how to use it effectively. There are many tricks and tips that can help you find what you are looking for faster and more accurately. In this blog post, we will show you how to use some of the most useful search syntaxes that can make you a Google pro.\r\n\r\n### What is Search Syntax?\r\n\r\nSearch syntax is a set of rules that tell Google how to interpret your query and what kind of results to return. You can use different symbols, words, and operators to modify your search and narrow down your options. Here are some of the most common and useful ones:\r\n\r\n- **Quotation marks** (\&quot;\&quot;): Use them to search for an exact phrase or word. For example, \&quot;how to bake a cake\&quot; will only show results that contain this exact phrase, while how to bake a cake will show results that contain any of these words in any order.\r\n- **Minus sign** (-): Use it to exclude a word or phrase from your search. For example, apple -pie will show results that contain apple but not pie, while apple pie -recipe will show results that contain apple pie but not recipe.\r\n- **Site**: Use it to search within a specific website or domain. For example, site:freecodecamp.org python will show results that are from freecodecamp.org and contain python, while site:.edu python will show results that are from any .edu domain and contain python.\r\n- **Related**: Use it to find websites that are similar to a given one. For example, related:nytimes.com will show websites that are similar to nytimes.com in terms of content, audience, or purpose.\r\n- **Asterisk** (_): Use it as a wildcard to replace any word or phrase. For example, how to _ a cake will show results that contain how to followed by any word or phrase and then followed by a cake, such as how to make a cake, how to decorate a cake, etc.\r\n- **Filetype**: Use it to search for files of a specific type. For example, filetype:pdf python will show results that are PDF files and contain python, while filetype:pptx marketing will show results that are PowerPoint presentations and contain marketing.\r\n- **OR**: Use it to combine two or more terms and show results that contain either one of them. For example, python OR java will show results that contain either python or java (or both), while \&quot;how to code\&quot; OR \&quot;learn programming\&quot; will show results that contain either how\r\n  to code or learn programming (or both).\r\n- **AND**: Use it to combine two or more terms and show results that contain all of them. For example, python AND java will show results that contain both python and java (not either one), while \&quot;how to code\&quot; AND \&quot;learn programming\&quot; will show results that contain both how to code and learn programming (not either one).\r\n- **Parentheses** (): Use them to group terms together and apply operators on them. For example,\r\n  (python OR java) AND (beginner OR tutorial) will show results that contain either python or java\r\n  and also either beginner or tutorial.\r\n\r\nThese are just some of the most common and useful search syntaxes you can use on Google. There are many more advanced ones that you can explore on your own if you want to become a true Google pro.\r\n\r\n### Why Should You Use Search Syntax?\r\n\r\nUsing search syntax can help you save time and effort when searching for something on Google. It can help you:\r\n\r\n- Find more relevant and accurate results\r\n- Filter out unwanted or irrelevant results\r\n- Compare different options or alternatives\r\n- Discover new information or sources\r\n\r\nBy using search syntax wisely, you can make your searches more efficient and effective.\r\n\r\n### How Can You Learn More About Search Syntax?\r\n\r\nIf you want to learn more about search syntax and how to use it on Google,\r\nyou can check out these resources:\r\n\r\n- [**_Google&#39;s official guide_**](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en) on how\r\n  to refine web searches with operators\r\n- [**_A comprehensive list_**](https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/) of all the Google advanced search operators by Ahrefs\r\n- [**_A cheat sheet_**](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/google-search-cheat-sheet/) with some of the most useful Google search tips by MakeUseOf\r\n\r\nWe hope this blog post has helped you understand how to use 👍\r\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;blogs&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Google It Like a Pro&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Anime website built with Bootstrap5, Swiper, Font Awesome, and custom CSS/JS.

Thank you for reading Getting Started with Python Virtual Environment. Thank you to all of you for supporting me. I am quite active; I post daily on Twitter and LinkedIn so if you like then give me a follow.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nA Python virtual environment is an isolated environment where you can install and manage packages and dependencies for your Python projects without affecting the system-wide Python installation or other projects.\r\n\r\nIn other words, a virtual environment allows you to create a separate sandboxed environment for each of your Python projects, each with its own set of Python libraries, without worrying about version conflicts or dependencies between projects.\r\n\r\nCreating a virtual environment also allows you to work on multiple projects that have different Python version requirements on the same machine, as each virtual environment can have its own version of Python installed.\r\n\r\nPython&#39;s built-in `venv` module allows you to create and manage virtual environments easily. Once you have created a virtual environment, you can activate it and use it as your default Python environment for that project.\r\n\r\n## Get Started\r\n\r\n1. Install the `virtualenv` python module by the following command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip install virtualenv\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you want to create the virtual environment, and run the following command:\r\n\r\nFor Windows\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nvirtualenv env\r\n```\r\n\r\nForLinux\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npython3 -m venv env\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will create a new virtual environment named `env` in the current directory. You can give whatever name you prefer.\r\n\r\n3. Once the virtual environment is created, you can activate it by running the following command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# In cmd\r\nenv\\Scripts\\activate.bat\r\n# In powershell\r\nenv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor Linux:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsource env/bin/activate\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will activate the virtual environment and change your prompt to indicate that you are now working inside the `env` environment.\r\n\r\n4. You can now install Python packages and dependencies inside the virtual environment using pip, just like you would in a normal Python environment. For example, you can install the `numpy` package by running:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip install numpy\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you are done working in the virtual environment, you can deactivate it by running:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndeactivate\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will return you to your normal system environment.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s it! You can now create and manage virtual environments for your Python projects, and keep your dependencies isolated and organized.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHi everyone, I am Bijoy Kar.

Thank you for reading Anime Website Built with Bootstrap5. Thank you to all of you for supporting me.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nGreetings everyone!\r\n\r\nI would like to share with you a website that I have built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap5, and JavaScript. Although the site is not entirely complete, I have established the basic structure of both the home and user pages.\r\n\r\n&lt;img src=\&quot;/anime-website-2.jpg\&quot; width=\&quot;100%\&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\nTo enhance the project, I utilized Bootstrap5 Swiper for the 3D slider and Font Awesome for icons. My approach to building the site involved dividing it into different sections by implementing the divide and conquer method.\r\n\r\nThe first section I created was the header and navbar section, where you can view the logo and sub-logo of the anime. The navbar remains sticky, and through the aid of JavaScript, it vanishes when scrolling down and reappears as a black-colored nav bar after a second. I employed Bootstrap5 to create the navbar.\r\n\r\nTo create the background wave style, I utilized an image that I designed using Photoshop, along with CSS styling. As the home section is the area that generates user interest, I implemented some animations in it. Although I planned to include a counter section, I decided against it for the time being.\r\n\r\nUsing Swiper, I then created a 3D slider and customized it using some JavaScript. I integrated the swiper cdnjs to include the swiper method.\r\n\r\nThe next section I designed was a card section for popular anime storyline discussion. I configured it as a card type using my customized CSS property and utilized some column and row property of Bootstrap5.\r\n\r\nIn the section featuring popular anime storylines, I decorated it with some offset column size. I selected a Doraemon image and divided it into six pieces according to their size, as much as possible by myself. If viewed on mobile, you will see a different photo. On hovering over it, it changes color with some gradient.\r\n\r\n&lt;img src=\&quot;/anime-website-3.jpg\&quot; width=\&quot;100%\&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\nThis website also includes images with transparent backgrounds, which I created using Adobe online server.\r\n\r\nIn the future, I plan to add packages to make it a commercial website, along with a contact form. I implemented this aspect later using the backend, so you can personally email me. Lastly, I added copyright to make the website legal.\r\n\r\nRegarding customization, I used my CSS and JavaScript to make it unique. Please visit the website link to view the site.\r\n\r\nOverall, I utilized Bootstrap 5 and various customizations with CSS and JavaScript to create this website. I hope to continue adding more features and improving it further.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThank you for reading this article.\r\n&quot;],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;blogs&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;Anime Website Built with Bootstrap5&quot;],&quot;description&quot;:[0,&quot;Anime website built with Bootstrap5, Swiper, Font Awesome, and custom CSS/JS.

Thank you for reading Git &amp; GitHub for Beginners. Thank you to all of you for supporting me. I am quite active, I post daily on Twitter and LinkedIn so if you like then give me a follow.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## What is Git ?\r\n\r\nGit is a distributed version control system used for software development and other types of version control. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to manage the development of the Linux kernel.\r\n\r\nGit allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously and keep track of changes made to the code. It allows developers to make changes to their local copy of the code and then commit those changes to a central repository, which can be accessed by other developers.\r\n\r\nGit is widely used in the software development industry because it makes it easy to collaborate with others, maintain multiple versions of a codebase, and track changes over time. It is also flexible and can be used with a variety of workflows and project structures.\r\n\r\n## Git Installation\r\n\r\nTo install git visit https://git-scm.com/downloads . Download git according to your operating system. In the setup wizard leave everything default.\r\n\r\n### Git Installation with Git\r\n\r\nVisit https://github.com/git/git and clone the repository and follow the installation guide\r\n`git clone https://github.com/git/git`\r\n\r\n## Get Started with Git\r\n\r\n### Basic Workflow of Git\r\n\r\n- To work with Git we need to initialize a directory as a git repository, means we need to tell git to make that folder / directory a git repository. To do so use this command\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit init\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the git initialization a `.git` directory will be created in the directory which is hidden. Here all the changes and commits data are stored.\r\n\r\n- Now we add some files to understand the workflow of git. We make a `python` file for example\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef add(a,b):\r\n\treturn a+b\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Now we are going to check the status of the local repository\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit status\r\n```\r\n\r\n&lt;img src=\&quot;/Pasted image 20230221131630.png\&quot;/&gt;\r\n\r\n- The `add.py` is untracked, to track the changes of the file we will stage the file.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit add add.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n`git add add.py` this command will stage only the `add.py` file.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit add .\r\n```\r\n\r\n`git add .` this command will stage all the new files or changed files in the local repository.\r\n\r\n&lt;img src=\&quot;/Pasted image 20230224120148.png\&quot;/&gt;\r\nNow the file is staged. The green colored file name indicate that it is tracked.\r\n\r\n- After staging the file now it is time to make a commit means making a checkpoint of the codebase. In future if we make a mistake or need this codebase then we can return here.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit commit -m\&quot;initial commit\&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\n&lt;img src=\&quot;/Pasted image 20230224120351.png\&quot;/&gt;\r\n\r\nEvery commit need a commit message here the message is \&quot;initial commit\&quot;. By the message we determine what changes are made in that commit. It is must to provide a commit message.\r\nBy convention we give the message of first commit \&quot;initial commit\&quot;.\r\n\r\n**_We are assuming that you have already a GitHub account and you can make a remote repository_**\r\n\r\n- Add the remote repository to your local directory\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit remote add origin &lt;url of your remote repo&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere `origin` is the name of remote repo, by convention we give the remote repo a name of `origin`\r\n\r\n- We make sure to `pull` before `push` changes into remote repo\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit pull origin master\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe format is `git pull &lt;remote repo name&gt; &lt;branch name&gt;`\r\n\r\n- By `push` we push our local changes or commits into remote repo\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit push origin master\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe format is `git push &lt;remote repo name&gt; &lt;branch name&gt;`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThank you for reading this article, if like to read more of my article then subscribe my newsletter Weekly Coding Dose and give a follow.

Thank you for reading ReactJs. Thank you to all of you for supporting me. I am quite active, I post daily on Twitter and LinkedIn so if you like then give me a follow.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nReact is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed and maintained by Facebook, and since its release in 2013, it has grown in popularity among web developers. React is used to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces, and it is considered one of the most efficient and easy-to-use libraries for this purpose.\r\n\r\nReact is based on the idea of components, which are individual units that make up the user interface. Each component is responsible for rendering a specific part of the user interface and handling its state and behavior. Components can be reused and composed to build complex user interfaces, making it easier to manage and maintain the code.\r\n\r\nOne of the key features of React is its ability to update the user interface in real-time based on changes in data. This is achieved through a mechanism known as the virtual DOM, which is a virtual representation of the actual DOM (Document Object Model) used by the browser. When a change in data occurs, React updates the virtual DOM, and then efficiently updates the actual DOM with the changes, minimizing the amount of work required to update the user interface.\r\n\r\nAnother key feature of React is its support for declarative programming. Declarative programming is a programming style that focuses on what the desired outcome is, rather than how to achieve it. With React, developers can declare the desired state of the user interface, and React takes care of the rest. This makes it easier to understand and debug the code, and also allows for greater flexibility in the user interface.\r\n\r\nReact also has a large and active community of developers who contribute to the library by writing open-source packages and plugins. These packages and plugins can be used to add additional functionality to React, such as support for animations, routing, and state management. This helps developers save time and effort by not having to reinvent the wheel and instead build on the work of others.\r\n\r\nReact is also used in conjunction with other libraries and tools, such as React Native, which allows developers to build native mobile applications using the same principles and concepts as React. This allows developers to write once and reuse the code across multiple platforms, reducing the amount of time and effort required to build and maintain applications.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, React is a powerful and versatile library for building user interfaces. Its focus on components, the virtual DOM, and declarative programming make it easy to build complex and dynamic user interfaces, and its active community of developers ensures that it continues to evolve and improve. Whether you&#39;re building a website, a mobile application, or a single-page application, React is a great choice for building high-quality user interfaces.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThank you for reading this article, if like to read more of my article then subscribe my newsletter Weekly Coding Dose and give a follow.

I am quite active, I post daily on Twitter and LinkedIn so if you like then give me a follow.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Introduction\r\n\r\nTypeScript is a programming language that is a super set of JavaScript. It was developed and is maintained by Microsoft. TypeScript adds optional static typing, class-based object-oriented programming, and other features to JavaScript. These features make it easier to write, maintain, and scale large applications.\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest advantages of TypeScript is its static typing. This means that variables, function parameters, and return types can be explicitly defined. This can help catch errors early on in the development process, before the code is even run. This can save a lot of time and effort in debugging and testing.\r\n\r\nTypeScript also adds support for classes and interfaces, which are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming. Classes allow for the creation of objects with specific properties and methods, and interfaces allow for the creation of a contract for objects to adhere to. These features make it easier to structure and organize code, making it more readable and maintainable.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage of TypeScript is its compatibility with existing JavaScript code. TypeScript code can be transpiled, or converted, into JavaScript, which can then be run on any platform that supports JavaScript. This means that developers can start using TypeScript in their existing JavaScript projects without having to completely rewrite the code.\r\n\r\nTypeScript also has a robust and active community, with many open-source libraries and frameworks available. This includes popular libraries such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, which have official TypeScript support. This means that developers can use TypeScript with these libraries and frameworks, taking advantage of its features while still using the tools they are familiar with.\r\n\r\nOverall, TypeScript is a powerful programming language that can make development easier, more efficient, and more scalable. Its static typing and object-oriented programming features can help catch errors early on and make code more readable and maintainable. Its compatibility with existing JavaScript code and active community make it a great choice for developers.\r\n\r\n# Advantages\r\n\r\n- Static Typing: TypeScript adds optional static typing, which means that variables, function parameters, and return types can be explicitly defined. This can help catch errors early on in the development process, before the code is even run, saving time and effort in debugging and testing.\r\n- Object-Oriented Programming: TypeScript adds support for classes and interfaces, which are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming. Classes allow for the creation of objects with specific properties and methods, and interfaces allow for the creation of a contract for objects to adhere to. This makes it easier to structure and organize code, making it more readable and maintainable.\r\n- Improved IntelliSense: TypeScript includes improved IntelliSense, an auto-completion and code-suggestion feature, which makes coding easier and more efficient. It also provides a better development experience with better error reporting and debugging.\r\n- Compatibility: TypeScript code can be transpiled, or converted, into JavaScript, which can then be run on any platform that supports JavaScript. This means that developers can start using TypeScript in their existing JavaScript projects without having to completely rewrite the code.\r\n- Large and Active Community: TypeScript has a robust and active community, with many open-source libraries and frameworks available. This includes popular libraries such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, which have official TypeScript support. This means that developers can use TypeScript with these libraries and frameworks, taking advantage of its features while still using the tools they are familiar with.\r\n- Better scalability: With TypeScript, codebase can be more scalable, maintainable and robust, especially in large projects, as it enforces a stricter code structure, and provides better error reporting.\r\n\r\n# Getting Started with TypeScript\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- Nodejs must be installed in your local system\r\n- Must know basics of JavaScript\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\n- **Install TypeScript**: First, you will need to install TypeScript on your computer. You can do this by running the command npm install -g typescript if you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. If you are using yarn, you can run the command yarn global add typescript.\r\n\r\n_npm install_ :\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install -g typescript\r\n```\r\n\r\n_yarn install_ :\r\n\r\n```\r\nyarn global add typescript\r\n```\r\n\r\n- **Create a TypeScript file**: Next, you will need to create a new file with a `.ts extension`. You can use any text editor to create this file. For example, you can create a file called `index.ts`.\r\n\r\n- **Write some TypeScript code**: In your new file, you can start writing TypeScript code. You can start by writing a simple function or variable and add types to it.\r\n  For example :\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nfunction getSum(first: number, second: number)\r\n    return first + second;\r\n}\r\nconsole.log(getSum(10, 11));\r\nconsole.log(getSum(13, 31));\r\nconsole.log(getSum(10.44, 115.11));\r\n```\r\n\r\n- **Compile the TypeScript code**: To run the TypeScript code, you need to first compile it into JavaScript. You can do this by running the command tsc index.ts in your terminal. This will create a new file called index.js in the same directory as your TypeScript file.\r\n\r\n```\r\ntsc index.ts\r\n```\r\n\r\n- **Run the JavaScript code**: Finally, you can run the generated JavaScript code by running the command node index.js in your terminal. This will execute your TypeScript code.\r\n\r\n```\r\nnode index.js\r\n```\r\n\r\n- **Use a TypeScript-enabled editor**: To improve development experience you can use a code editor that supports TypeScript, such as Visual Studio Code, WebStorm, or Atom. They provide features like code completion, error highlighting, and debugging which are helpful when working with TypeScript.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThank you for reading this article, if like to read more of my article then subscribe my newsletter Weekly Coding Dose and give a follow.

Thank you for reading How to make a random quotes API with flask. Thank you to all of you for supporting me. I am quite active, I post daily on Twitter and LinkedIn so if you like then give me a follow.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHere is an example of how you might create a simple REST API for generating random quotes using the Flask web framework in Python:\r\n\r\n1.  Start by installing Flask using pip:\r\n\r\n```cmd\r\npip install Flask\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.  Create a new file called app.py and import the Flask module:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom flask import Flask, jsonify\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.  Create an instance of the Flask class and define a route for the root URL:\r\n\r\n```python\r\napp = Flask(__name__) @app.route(\&quot;/\&quot;)\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.  Define a function that will return a random quote when the root URL is accessed. For this example, you can hardcode a list of quotes and use the Python built-in random.choice() function to select one at random.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport random quotes = [ {\&quot;author\&quot;: \&quot;Albert Einstein\&quot;, \&quot;quote\&quot;: \&quot;Imagination is more important than knowledge.\&quot;}, {\&quot;author\&quot;: \&quot;Steve Jobs\&quot;, \&quot;quote\&quot;: \&quot;Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.\&quot;}, {\&quot;author\&quot;: \&quot;Mark Twain\&quot;, \&quot;quote\&quot;: \&quot;The secret of getting ahead is getting started.\&quot;}, {\&quot;author\&quot;: \&quot;Mahatma Gandhi\&quot;, \&quot;quote\&quot;: \&quot;The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.\&quot;} ]\r\n@app.route(\&quot;/\&quot;)\r\ndef get_quote():\r\n  quote = random.choice(quotes)\r\n  return jsonify(quote)\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.  Lastly, you need to run the app.py file with flask command\r\n\r\n```python\r\nif __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:\r\n  app.run(debug=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow if you run your app by typing flask run in your terminal and navigate to http://localhost:5000/ in your web browser, you should see a randomly-selected quote displayed in JSON format.\r\nThis is just a basic example, you can use external APIs, database or any other method to store quotes and generate random quotes based on the requirement. Additionally, you can add more functionality like filtering, pagination etc.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThank you for reading this article, if like to read more of my article then subscribe my newsletter Weekly Coding Dose and give a follow.

Thank you for reading JavaScript vs Python. Thank you to all of you for supporting me. I am quite active, I post daily on Twitter and LinkedIn so if you like then give me a follow.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPython and JavaScript are two of the most popular programming languages in the world. They are both widely used in web development, data science, and many other fields, but they have some key differences that set them apart.\r\nOne of the main differences between Python and JavaScript is the way they are designed. Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that is known for its simplicity and ease of use. It has a large standard library and a large community of users who contribute to the development of libraries and frameworks that make it easier to use.\r\n\r\nJavaScript, on the other hand, is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is primarily used for building web applications. It is used to create interactive elements on websites, such as drop-down menus and forms. JavaScript is also used on the server-side through the use of Node.js, which allows developers to build scalable network applications with JavaScript.\r\nAnother key difference between Python and JavaScript is their syntax. Python uses indentation to denote blocks of code, whereas JavaScript uses curly braces. This can make Python code easier to read and understand, especially for beginners.\r\n\r\nOne area where Python excels is in data science and scientific computing. It has a number of powerful libraries, such as NumPy and Pandas, that make it easy to work with large datasets and perform complex statistical analyses. JavaScript, on the other hand, is not as well-suited for these tasks, although it is possible to do data science work with it using tools like D3.js.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, JavaScript has a number of advantages when it comes to web development. It is the primary language used for front-end web development, and it is supported by all modern web browsers. This means that it is easy to use JavaScript to build interactive elements on websites and create a seamless user experience. Python, on the other hand, is more commonly used on the back-end, where it is used to build server-side applications and APIs.\r\n\r\nIn summary, Python and JavaScript are both powerful programming languages with their own unique strengths and weaknesses. Python is a general-purpose language that is well-suited for data science and scientific computing, while JavaScript is primarily used for building web applications and creating interactive elements on websites. Ultimately, which language is best for a particular task will depend on the specific needs and goals of the project.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThank you for reading this article, if like to read more of my article then subscribe my newsletter Weekly Coding Dose and give a follow.
